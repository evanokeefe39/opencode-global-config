# General Guidelines

Applies to all agents and development workflows.

- Write clean, modular code.
- Use consistent file naming (lowercase, hyphen-separated).
- Keep temporary files in `.agent-name/` folders ignored by git.
- Never commit secrets or credentials.
- Follow PROJECT_RULES.md for context-specific rule loading.
