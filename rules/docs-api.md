# API Docs Rules
- Use mkdocstrings for Python (mkdocstrings[python]) and TypeScript (mkdocstrings[typescript]) when present.
- Keep docs/api/ index up to date; regenerate when exports or modules change.
- Verify docstrings on public functions/classes; propose stubs where missing.
- Do not include private/internal members unless explicitly requested.
