# Documentation Authoring Guide
- Keep pages short and focused; link out for details.
- Use admonitions for tips and warnings.
- Prefer examples that can be copy-pasted and run.
- Cross-link related topics with relative links.
- Include MCP tool usage in examples where applicable, demonstrating replacements for CLI commands (e.g., GitHub MCP for PR ops).
